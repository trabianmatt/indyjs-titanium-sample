The content of this file is unimportant other than to explain the
purpose of it.

This file is here to provide an easy way of rebuilding the app and restarting
the simulator. If you modify this file (or 'touch' it) while the
t:iphone:run or t:android:run cake actions are running then the app will
rebuilt and the simulator will be restarted.

A handy trick is to setup a keyboard command in your IDE of choice to
'touch' this file.

Here's a Vim command:

map <D-r> :call system('touch ' . 'tmp/restart.txt')<CR>
imap <D-r> <esc>:call system('touch ' . 'tmp/restart.txt')<CR>
